Done: -make block_qx return link name qx instead of ql,lq,qr,rq
Done: -calculate getV,setV offsets from matrix_state
Done: -We need pure upper/lower enums without diagonal and full options
-further simplify the compress H loop
-Need to save SV spectrum somewhere
-Look into the MPS compession code for inspiration.
-Get min and max Dw from H
-Figure out how to turn off asserts for performance.
-consistent variable names for link indexs r,c,q,u,v or ir,ic,iq,iu,iv ?
Fixed: #grow(i1,W,i2) relies on index ordering inside W ... is that bad?? (hint:yes!)
Done: -grow(i1,W,i2) --> grow(W,i1,i2)
-Fix known fail for compressing when H has 8 NNN
    Do tidy up items first.
Done -Get RQ decomp going. in order to ....
Done -Support upper-tri MPOs
-Support rank releavling QR,RQ,QL,LQ
Done: -Clean up canonical and compress code.
Done: -reduce two block_qx functions to one
-Do we need to copy W in block_qx?
-Comment indices in canonical!(...)
