Questions:
  -Should we be using findinds or just inds?
  -Delete old branches, after merge?
  -epsrr -> rr_cutoff or just cutoff like for SVD?
  -Future of Model("model_name") framework.
  -verbose mode? (only see it in ctmrg)
  -subtensor function
  	-Must handle block sparse
  	-I only need it for link indices
  	-Use combiners to combine all non-affected indices?
  	-Do the work in NDTensors
  	-functon interface
  	subtensor(A::Itensor,i::Pair(Index,range)...)
  -Is there use for a moving orthogonality center in MPOs?
  	

More tests:
-Test alternating S=1/2 and S=1 sites.
-Test Fermions/Hubberd.
-vumps GS example with timing for uncomp./comp.

Features:
-Verbose mode show all Dws and steps orth-right etc.
-Put some content in Readme.md
-make truncate, and orthogonalize that work on copies.

Improvements:
-Pare down unit test for shorter run time.
  -Very hard, lots of CPU time on compiling inside ITensors for GS energy tests
  -Using a sysimage for ITensors does not seem to help!
-Profile and code coverage.
-Gs returned by truncate should be Diag not Dense tensors.
5) Use new is_upper functions using combiners to get rank-2 tensors.
-Add some sort of Results section at the end of the tech docs.
-Review high level algos
  -rules for smart_sweep
  -orthog inside truncate
  -convergence in truncate?
  -epsrr=0.0 not allowed in truncate?
-Switch from epsrr to rr_cutoff
-better name for pbc? inf open_chain, boundary_conditions
-Clean up SetV code.  Use dummy Dw=1 index trick instead of SetV1 code.
-Enforce expected type for all get(kwargs) calls


Fix Unknown:
-For RL_prime problems, try factor R+ = R'*M (instread of M*R) then R' will be square.
  THis will only work if R' is orthogonal R_dagger'*R' = Id

        cutoff  Using a cutoff allows the SVD algorithm to truncate as many states as possible while still ensuring a certain accuracy.

Matts emails:
Nice meeting you and thanks again for offering to help us out with the development of ITensor!

Here are the Julia development tools that were brought up, and some other ones I thought of:

Julia debuggers (the primary ones appear to be the one built into the Julia VSCode extension and Debugger.jl):
https://opensourc.es/blog/basics-debugging/
https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/userguide/debugging/
https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Debugger.jl

Julia vim plugin:
https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim

OhMyREPL for nice syntax highlighting in the Julia REPL:
https://github.com/KristofferC/OhMyREPL.jl

Revise is absolutely critical for developing Julia packages, since it allows you to edit code when you are developing Julia packages and have the changes immediately reflected outside the package, without restarting the Julia session:
https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl

I would also recommend using the JuliaMono font to help with viewing unicode (many fonts have limited unicode support):
https://juliamono.netlify.app/

Here is the profile visualization tool I use:
https://github.com/timholy/ProfileView.jl

For a graph visualization of the profile you can use:
https://github.com/JuliaPerf/PProf.jl
https://opensourc.es/blog/constraint-solver-profiling/

And here is the code I wrote for making an operator valued matrix from an MPO:
https://github.com/ITensor/ITensorInfiniteMPS.jl/blob/main/src/vumps_mpo.jl#L36-L64

We actually have an immediate application of the MPO compression in Julia (there is an intern working on a project where he is renormalizing a local Hamiltonian by a unitary circuit, so it would be great to automatically compress the MPO instead of computing the new Hamiltonian more manually). I also have some quantum chemistry applications where that would be useful. I think that would be a top priority, though of course feel free to work on whatever peaks your interest most.

I don't think you need any particular Hamiltonian. A useful test would be to start with any local Hamiltonian (say the Heisenberg model) and time evolve it by any local local circuit, it could even be totally random gates. I'm attaching an example you could start from.

Unfortunately there is a slightly circular logic in this example, since the lines:

UHU = apply(U, H; apply_dag=true, cutoff=1e-15)

that performs the circuit evolution also does an MPO truncation, however it uses the naive form of truncation that treats the MPO as a state. It would also take the MPO out of the upper/lower triangular form. So I guess we would have to think about how the basis rotation should actually be applied in this case. Ultimately the goal would be for the apply have an option where you can specify the MPO should be treated as a local Hamiltonian and truncated using the Parker et al. algorithm.

Let me know if you think that example makes sense and if there is a way you could make use of it. Perhaps it is best to think about it in terms of just applying one of the gates of the circuit at a time, and truncating just the bond where it is applied. In that way, we could engineer the gate so it is applied at first without truncation and then truncated using the Parker et al. algorithm.

Also, maybe it is helpful to know that you can turn the circuit into an MPO like this:

Id = MPO(OpSum() + ("Id", 1), s)
Umpo = apply(U, Id; cutoff=1e-15)

That form could make it easier to apply the circuit (or just a gate) to the Hamiltonian MPO to keep it in a form where it can be used with the Parker et al. algorithm.
